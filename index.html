            <p>This is a site dedicated to a close friend of mine, Theodore Thuang. <br>
            I have a lot of respect for him. <br> Theodore is a friend that has been by my side for nearly 20 years. I have seen him grow and learn an incredible amount over this time. Theodore has always had a strong work ethic while having a great sense of humor. </p>
