        <div class="text-box">Theodore loves to spend his free time golfing with his dad. They typically are only going around the different golf courses found on Hawaii.
            However, they have gone on a golfing tour around the Philippines in the past. They both hope to go on another golfing trip in the soon in the future.
            <br><br>Here he is taking a quick selfie with his dad in the background attempting to sink a put for an eagle. </div>

        <div class="text-box">Theodore loves cooking. Even though he does it for work, 60+ hours a week, he still finds himself in the kitchen in his free time. Theodore just loves being able to create these tasty meals that he can share with his friends and family.
            I can give him a list of ingredients I have around the house and he can usually come up with something pretty quickly. The best results are when I call
        him for a specific recipe.
        <br><br>Theodore is shown here goofing off in the kitchen while at work.</div>

        <div class="text-box">Airsoft is another one of Theodore's hobbies. Theodore currently has about 6 different airsoft guns that he rotates around on his monthly airsoft games that he participates in.
        <br><br>Theodore is here with a few of his buddies before an "Aloha Shirt" themed game.</div>
