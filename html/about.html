            <p class="paragraph">Theodore grew up in the heart of Hawaii, in the small town of Wahiawa. Their childhood was
filled with family-oriented experiences, including frequent trips to the Philippines to connect
with relatives and explore their cultural roots. These early experiences instilled a deep
appreciation for family and heritage that continues to shape Theodore’s life and aspirations.
                <br>Surprisingly, Theodore’s journey into the culinary arts began at an unlikely place, a movie
theater. This wasn’t your typical concession stand, though. The theater served full meals, which
sparked Theodore’s curiosity about food. Friends pursuing culinary careers further encouraged
this interest, and soon, Theodore discovered their own passion for crafting delicious dishes.
That passion led them to culinary school, where they achieved their proudest accomplishment:
graduating with a renewed sense of purpose and direction. It was during this time that
Theodore realized just how deeply they loved the art of cooking.
                <br>Today, Theodore dreams of opening their own gastropub, a cozy, lively space serving skewers
and drinks, all inspired by their Filipino heritage. While this goal may feel ambitious, it’s a
driving force behind their continued efforts to grow as a chef and entrepreneur.
                <br>Outside the kitchen, Theodore enjoys a balance of active and relaxing hobbies. They often play
golf with friends and family, engage in airsoft games, or, on quieter days, immerse themselves in
movies and video games. But even in their downtime, cooking remains their greatest passion.
They’re always experimenting with new recipes, exploring unfamiliar ingredients, and finding
joy in watching others enjoy their creations.
                <br>Theodore draws inspiration from their father, whom they describe as the ultimate role model.
Watching him work tirelessly to support their family taught Theodore the values of hard work,
perseverance, and genuine care for others. When asked how they’d like to be described,
Theodore hopes people see them as funny, hard-working, and genuine, qualities that reflect
both their personality and aspirations. Looking ahead, Theodore envisions a future where their
passion for cooking and community converges, bringing their dream gastropub to life, a place
where people can gather, share great food, and enjoy meaningful connections.</p>
